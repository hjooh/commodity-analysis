# WHEAT 2.18.2025
Claire, Ryan, Nic

Topics of Interest
1. Import/Export
    (a) By country
    (b) By commodity - SRW and its relevant substitutes (include all classes of wheat)
    (c) By size..?
    (d) Byproducts (meal, oil for soybeans)

2. WASDE (balance sheet)
    (a) Inspections 
        - Things that are meant to be exported, inspected
        - **MORE important than export sales** because exports can get reneged on
        - Note that final sales also gets documented, could be interesting to explore (how much we trust those exports?)
        - Probably only domestic trade data... United States -> would be good to look into 
    (b) Production Data
        - Historical WASDE estimates
            - Yield
            - Acreage: Planted, Harvested
            - Total Production = Yield * Harvested
            - **Trying to forecast mid-season**
    (c) Stocks, Stocks to Use Ratio

3. Countries of Interest
    - RU, UA, BR, AU, EU, AR, CN, JP, PH, MX
    - How much of their total supply/imports that we're contributing to... usually just estimates -> lots of revisions

4. Forecasting
    - Goal: Forecast everything on the balance sheet
    - Depending on where we are in the season, will be forecasting different things
        - Forecast planted acres... won't find out until halfway through spring but can use prices of corn and soybeans -> estimations


Short-Term Focus
- Wheat: Harvested
- Soybeans: Planted
- Corn: Planted
- Production (Acreage and Total Production), stocks to use and how it affects price (bottom line of the WASDE balance sheet)
    - How does stocks to use affect the ETF? 
    - Connect the two, find a signal (speculative)
- Build naive balance sheet forecast, then expand

Milestones
1. Successfully pull and display data
2. Naive balance sheet forecast using a simple ARIMA model
3. Future planning
